# Loan Repayment Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Loan Repayment Prediction Project! This repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of successful loan repayment by borrowers.

## Project Goals and Objectives

- **Identify Key Factors:** To identify key factors that have a significant impact on the loan repayment behavior of borrowers.

- **Evaluate Predictive Models:** To compare and evaluate the performance of different predictive models for loan repayment prediction.

- **ROC Curve Analysis:** Compare ROC curves of different predictive models and determine the model with the highest area under the curve (AUC) for loan repayment prediction.

- **Select Best Model:** To identify and select the best predictive model that provides accurate and reliable loan repayment predictions.

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the probability of borrowers successfully repaying their loans. Accurate loan repayment prediction is vital for financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, reduce risks, and promote responsible lending practices.
